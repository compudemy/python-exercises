# The arithmetic sequence is given with the following formula:

# an = 10 + 4n

# Calculate the sum of the first ten elements of this sequence. Print the result to the console as shown below.

# Expected result:

# The sum of the first 10 elements in a sequence: 320.0


# n=[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]

# for i in n
#     a = 10 + 4*n[i]
#     total = sum(a)

# print(f"The sum of the first 10 elements in a sequence {total:1f}")
