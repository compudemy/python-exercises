# The quadratic equation is given with the following formula:

# x^2 + 5x + 4 = 0

# Using Vieta's formulas calculate the sum and product of the roots of this quadratic equation. Print the result to the console as shown below.

# Expected result:

# x1 + x2 = -5.0
# x1x2 = 4.0


a = 1
b = 5
c = 4
sum = -b / a
product = c / a
print(f'x1 + x2 = {sum}\nx1x2 = {product}')
